    <h1>Productivity App</h1>
      <p class="project-intro">From 2015 - 2017 I worked on a 40-person team building web/native apps to create a better work environment for soft services employees. Our product, dubbed “Insite,” focused on core features like time tracking, messaging, and location-based services, as well extensive desktop reporting tools for managers.<br /><br />I joined the team as the product was making it’s transition from “rev1” to “rev2” - core functionality existed, but the design was frustrating end users and had yet to receive desirable feedback from our customers and their employees in the field. While I worked on just about every interface in the product suite, I’ll walk through a larger feature improvement to showcase our process and results.</p>

      <p>Problem</p>
      <p>During the beginning of 2016 we began to work through a core feature that so far had almost no adoption - the  “Message Center.” At the time, this feature only included functionality for corporate campaigns (messages sent from corporate to the front line employees) and was largely ignored by many of our end users.</p>
      <p>The first iteration of the messaging workflow was problematic, confusing, and although it it was feature-rich (for a first pass), it was difficult for users to leverage the functionality</p>

      <p class="emphasis">2. Speak Directly with test group</p>
      <p>After establishing a few potential approaches and feature improvements, we met with a test group of users a few towns over (at a site that represented one of a handful of cross-sections we had established over the previous years). We walked the group through a questionnaire we drafted in the initial review, pushing for both qualitative and quantitative feedback. Typically our user interviews would consist of questions along the lines of “if you could _ blank _ would it save you time throughout the day?” and “is _ blank _ something that you would use even if it wasn’t a requirement of your job?”</p>
      <p>One of our key findings from this phase was confirmation of a concern I had in regards to language used in the feature -  our diversion from industry terminology was causing confusion, and actions were not matching the expectation of our users. UX writing is crucial!</p>

      <p class="emphasis">3. Wireframes, process flows, and internal design review</p>
      <p>After collecting feedback from the test group, we were able to establish a feature list to guide our layout and design of the improved Message Center. From this feature list, I put together diagrams and wireframes defining three core options in regards to navigation, placement of action triggers, and overall layout. As one of our issues was familiarity, my efforts included review of existing mail and messaging tools (Gmail, Mailchimp, Outlook, etc).</p>
      <p>We then met with the team to review, ask questions, and choose a design direction. More whiteboard walls...</p>

      <p>After reviewing with the design team, our next step was to work through the visual design of the new feature. We were designing within an existing ecosystem, but there were a handful of unique components that needed to be designed to fit the needs of the Message Center.</p>

      <p class="emphasis">5. Stakeholder Review</p>
      <p>Our team would regularly review new designs and features with stakeholders that didn’t work within our software world. In an attempt to improve these discussions, the lead designer would create visual aides to explain the advantages of the changes as well as some of the logic behind our teams’ decision-making. <br /><br /></p>

      <p class="emphasis">6. Handoff & Implementation</p>
      <p>The last step with all design improvements was a review with our development team to run through the changes, and would include sprint planning and the definition of acceptance criteria. The design team worked closely with development to make sure there were no questions or missing information, and would review releases as they were added to our beta and finally our live product.</p>

      <p>Wrap up and thoughts</p>
      <p>Our design team regularly reviewed the live tool with our test groups, and would gain insights on features and their performance based on their feedback in an ongoing cycle. Although the Message Center didn’t make it back into the review cycle directly during my time on the team, we did see an increase in utilization of the message builder (we dramatically overhauled the creation of messages in our efforts) by a little over 200%, as well an an increased open rate of end users by 75%<br /><br />I hope this example of my time in the talented team at SBM gives a better look into my experience, my approach to the design process, as well as my ability to lead and own the process required to solve tough product problems. <br /><br />If you would like to speak directly to members of my team at SBM for further information regarding my skills and ‘bedside manner’ please contact my old director <a href="mailto:dougridleydesigns@gmail.com">Doug Ridley</a>, or my previous coworker <a href="mailto:sean.singleton@gmail.com">Sean Singleton.</a> <br /><br /></p>
