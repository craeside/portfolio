      <p class="project-intro">“Dark UI? What’s that? Wait… you can make it look like that?”<br /><br />The goal of the project was to design a tool that gives a network operations team a consolidated view of their network data, focused on alerts and problem solving. Disclaimer: This project has been changed from it's original version to protect the data of the client.</p>

      <p>This project was a 3 month engagement for a network operations team that needed us to design a dashboard with monitoring and troubleshooting features. The client and their in-house engineers had outlined their baseline needs as well as the majority of the rules engine details that would drive the “alerts” to be used in the tool. Most of the work was accomplished in Sketch, with some supplemental styling done by me with CSS/Splunk.</p>
